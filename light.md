# Lighting & Textures

## Overview

To convey my theme, I kept a very dark, but busy styling to textures, with a distinct use of marble and gold colorings, as well as a lot of art, these things being habits banks had to create a sense of wealth in the 1920's within America. There was also a swing to a sort of red-ish, neo-gothic architecture I tried my best to replicate within the Threnchbroom limitations.

Inversly where an open space like this would be lighted rather graciously, I chose to keep lighting rather focused only in spaces where there would be high security, that would need to see well in that spot. this pushes the idea that this building is *closed*, furthered by the street- light exclusive lighting outside, otherwise dark.

I only used one pre existing wad, and the order absolutely went in doing textures first, so how the colors reacted to the light would not cause me to have to go back to rework something I had already done early.

The break room, as pictured above, would not be considered a high focus spot for security to look at. Likely, the camera would be focused on the camera about. As the bank is colsed, there wouldn't be any lights on accept for the ones requred for security, leaving this room as seeable, but stil relatively dark.

This room being the vault, this is possible *the* highest security location on the premisis, so naturally lighting will be very cramped up for security purposes. Additionally tough, I felt it fitting that this sort of heavenly light be cast upon the gold, as that's the whole reason the player is there within the story.
