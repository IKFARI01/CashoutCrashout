# Descriptiion & Video

In starting my blockout, I began with a basic outline of the space, since I wanted the building to look somewhat uniform with what skyscraper buildings do, with a uniform room space throughout the floors. After that I began on basic room outlines, and where major walls would sit throughout the space, as well as the purpose of said walls.

This is when it very much became a room-to-room basis, where some rooms took a lot of planning as they were major fight spots that had very specific needs, like the 3rd floor with the elevator, as well as the balcony. Some though, were rather easy to block out, as their rooms were more serving a sense of place than anything else, such as a meeting room on the second floor.
