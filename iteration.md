# Iteration 1

## Description & Video

[Video Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/wZRGpLUp_tc)

In starting my blockout, I began with a basic outline of the space, since I wanted the building to look somewhat uniform with what skyscraper buildings do, with a uniform room space throughout the floors. After that I began on basic room outlines, and where major walls would sit throughout the space, as well as the purpose of said walls.

This is when it very much became a room-to-room basis, where some rooms took a lot of planning as they were major fight spots that had very specific needs, like the 3rd floor with the elevator, as well as the balcony. Some though, were rather easy to block out, as their rooms were more serving a sense of place than anything else, such as a meeting room on the second floor.

# Iteration 2

## Description

This iteration is now not only made in more detail and textured, but lighted. I began with texturing the interior bank, starting at the first floor and working my way up with time. I then began on exterior details getting textures, such as the road closed signs, and then chose patterns on the simple other buildings that came across as actual buildings despite being very simple in comparision.

Then I worked in an opposite order, working in order of gameplay path to light the space (More on lighting later) and creating a skybox in order to be able to test lighting effectively, and to fully encompass the night in which the player would be robbing this bank. Finally I actually placed the level finish, which had not been placed prior.

After this I was able to focus on gameplay details, adding 2 explosion boxes to balance play for the player should the player become more deperate, as well as increasing enemy population on the second floor, and removing some on the final level, due to the cramped space in which the player faces them creating enough difficulty as is.

## Ideas

### Architectural Theme

To convey my theme, I kept a very dark, but busy styling to textures, with a distinct use of marble and gold colorings, as well as a lot of art, these things being habits banks had to create a sense of wealth in the 1920's within America. There was also a swing to a sort of red-ish, neo-gothic architecture I tried my best to replicate within the Threnchbroom limitations.

Additionally in order to give the bank a true sense of place, I included a teller station, a table where people would often set up and cash checks, and an office, of which private meetings could take place. The teller's room as I call it, carries a great deal of weight in making it feel like a bank, however the vault is another room with a similar responsibility, having safe deposit boxes inside it, as well as the classic image of stacks of gold, silver, and more stored in the small room.

### Gameplay Variety

One major wow moment I hinge on is the first room, a grand display of detail work and multiple levels of space in the single room. Not only was that sort of epicness in theme with the time and place. It also happens to have a lot of combat, as logically, a bank would rather prevent you from getting anywhere near the vault, then send all the forces of security until the last moment before they lose everything. 

To contrast this epicness, the break room is not as nice at all. After all, it's just the breakroom, not meant to be seen by any customers, and not the actual workspace of anyone. Reasonably, no effort really would be made into making it look incredibly fancy at all, and being right after the teller's room, it creates a stark contrast.

### Encounter Modification
One encounter that was modified was the vault's hallway. While they would certainly establish security here, what I found on the elevator's accent, is they all hounded at once without any placed for you to move. Foe that reason, I added an explosion box. That way, while upon first accending you might still struggle, the player can see the explosion box and on their second time up, aim directly for it, killing all enemies in that spot.
