# Iteration 1

## Descriptiion & Video

[Video Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/wZRGpLUp_tc)

In starting my blockout, I began with a basic outline of the space, since I wanted the building to look somewhat uniform with what skyscraper buildings do, with a uniform room space throughout the floors. After that I began on basic room outlines, and where major walls would sit throughout the space, as well as the purpose of said walls.

This is when it very much became a room-to-room basis, where some rooms took a lot of planning as they were major fight spots that had very specific needs, like the 3rd floor with the elevator, as well as the balcony. Some though, were rather easy to block out, as their rooms were more serving a sense of place than anything else, such as a meeting room on the second floor.

# Iteration 2

## Description

This iteration is now not only made in more detail and textured, but lighted. I began with texturing the interior bank, starting at the first floor and working my way up with time. I then began on exterior details getting textures, such as the road closed signs, and then chose patterns on the simple other buildings that came across as actual buildings despite being very simple in comparision.

Then I worked in an opposite order, working in order of gameplay path to light the space (More on lighting later) and creating a skybox in order to be able to test lighting effectively, and to fully encompass the night in which the player would be robbing this bank. Finally I actually placed the level finish, which had not been placed prior.

After this I was able to focus on gameplay details, adding 2 explosion boxes to balance play for the player should the player become more deperate, as well as increasing enemy population on the second floor, and removing some on the final level, due to the cramped space in which the player faces them creating enough difficulty as is.
