# Description
  My map at this point had been fully blocked out, and had a level of interior detail in it's iteration. The bank itself was built, as well as a road and simple cubes that would represent other buildings in this metropolitan space. Additionally, road blockers such as road closed signs, and a dumpster had been modeled to prevent off-path navigation.

# Results

3 different players found that:

  . Hostiles were rotated so that they were not facing the player, and would simply sit still
  
  . The entrance to the top level that led to the vault being an elevator allowed the hostiles to stand waiting at the top once the player was first spotted, in a way spawn camping the player and significantly decreasing completion rates
  
  . The outdoors were high reward only to have no risk involved, and not considered secrets to allow for an extra accomplishment stat

  .Building's front looked rather uninteresting and uncharacteristic of the 1920's

# Takeaways

  . I added an explosion box and lessened the enemies at the elevator's exit, allowing for a more evenly balanced fight

  . Enemies were added throughout the space in the outdoors, and these sections were marked as secrets in the space

  . Hostile's placements and angles were corrected to create effective play

  . Buildings fronts was made to be more reminicent of the times
